# Paste.Keeplink.In

Paste is a simple to use and easy to access code/text and sharing tool made for the community.

## Basic Usage

Type what you want me to see, click "Save", and then copy the URL.  Send that
URL to someone and they'll see what you see.

To make a new entry, click "New" (or type 'control + n')

## Duration

Pastes will stay for 30 days from their last view.  They may be removed earlier
and without notice.

## Privacy

While the contents of hastebin.com are not directly crawled by any search robot
that obeys "robots.txt", there should be no great expectation of privacy.  Post
things at your own risk. Not responsible for any loss of data or removed
pastes.

## Open Source

Paste can easily be installed behind your network, and it's all open source!
